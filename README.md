# Stroke Prediction and Analysis

## Overview

This repository contains the resources and code used for predicting and analyzing stroke occurrences. Our project leverages data science techniques to provide insights and build a predictive model for strokes. The repository includes the following components:

- **CSV Files:** The dataset used for analysis and model training.
- **Reports:** Detailed documentation and analysis reports.
- **PowerPoint Presentations:** Slides summarizing our findings and methodology.
- **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis):** Scripts and visualizations for initial data exploration.
- **Data Analysis:** Code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
